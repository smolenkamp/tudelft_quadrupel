//! # tudelft quadrupel support library
//!
//! This library re-exports some crates (see below). That just makes it
//! easy for your drone code to use those libraries. For example:
//! ```
//! use tudelft_quadrupel::cortex_m;
//! ```

/// Utilities to control the leds on the board.
///
/// Note that in the template,
/// some leds have already been assigned meaning:
///
/// * red blinking: you probably have a panic
/// * blue blinking: your code is probably running fine
/// * yellow on + red blinking: this happens during initialization. If initialization fails,
///   this is never turned off. If a panic happens and yellow is on, initialization likely failed
/// * green on + red blinking: an allocation happened causing a panic.
///
/// You are free to change the meaning of these leds (though some restrictions apply, see the assignment manual).
